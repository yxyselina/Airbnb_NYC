BA775 Project - TEAM B06 AIRBNB DATA ANALYSIS

This is a class project by using Google Cloud Platform - BigQuery. We want to first appreaciate the instruction of our Professor Mohammad Soltanieh Ha who has given us a lot of support on learning query-structure data analysis and visualization. And also thanks to people who provide valuable feedbacks which help us improve a lot, especially our TA Ritwick Roy.  

Contributor for this project including Prateek Naharia, Kwan Wing Tuet, Hengyuan Cao, Xueyi(Sherry) Cao and Xingyu(Selina) Yao. 

Airbnb has become one of the major platforms with abundant resources of accommodation offerings. While it continuously maps the needs of guests and hosts, there are evidently some listings or hosts that have higher performance/popularity than others. Therefore, in our project, we will analyze factors that contributed to listing performance including review, price, availability and location. Our dataset is collected from Kaggle source and it oringal source is from Airbnb open data. Below are the reference.
